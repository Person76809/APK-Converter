# APK-Converter
This protect is code that allows you to get the APK file from the app on you phone. This will only work on Android devices. 

The button that allows the user to select an app. Once an app is selected, the onActivityResult method is triggered, and it attempts to retrieve the APK file path of the selected app. The APK file path can be used for further actions like sharing via email or other means.

This approach will only work for apps that are already installed on the device and will require appropriate permissions in the app's manifest file, such as READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE. Additionally, this code provides a basic template, and you may need to modify it based on your specific requirements.

This requires user interaction to manually share the APK file rather than automatically generating it.
